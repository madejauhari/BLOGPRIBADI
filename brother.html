            <h1>My Brother is my motivation</h1>
            <p>I have a wonderful older brother who is currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Aquatic Science and Fisheries. His passion for the environment and marine life is evident in everything he does. He spends countless hours studying aquatic ecosystems and researching sustainable practices that can help preserve our oceans and waterways. His dedication to his studies is inspiring, and I often find myself learning from him about the intricacies of marine biology and the importance of protecting our natural resources.</p>
            <p>He has a unique ability to make complex topics easy to understand, often sharing interesting facts and insights that spark my curiosity. I admire his commitment to making a difference in the field, and I can see his future filled with exciting opportunities to contribute to environmental conservation.</p>
            <p>In addition to my brother, I have a younger sibling who is in junior high school. Their youthful energy and enthusiasm for learning bring joy to our family. We often share stories and jokes, and they look up to my brother and me, eagerly absorbing everything we have to offer. Itâ€™s heartwarming to see how they are growing and discovering their own interests.</p>
            <p>Our family also has cousins who live in Kekeran and Tamblang. Whenever we visit them, itâ€™s always a blast! They are incredibly fun and engaging, making every gathering a memorable experience. We share countless laughs, play games, and bond over our adventures, strengthening our family ties. The joy of being together, exchanging stories, and creating lasting memories fills our hearts with happiness.</p>
            <p>Overall, my brother, my younger sibling, and our cousins make for a vibrant and supportive network. Together, we encourage each other to chase our dreams and explore the world around us, and I wouldnâ€™t trade this familial bond for anything.</p>
