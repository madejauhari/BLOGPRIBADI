            <h1>My Journey</h1>
            <p>My name is Made Jauhari, the second of three siblings, raised in a family where independence and responsibility were emphasized from an early age. Growing up, I learned the importance of hard work and self-reliance, values that have guided me through both personal and academic challenges. Today, I am pursuing my passion for technology as a student at Universitas Udayana, where I’m enrolled in the Information Technology program, class of 2022. Currently in my 5th semester, I have immersed myself in the fascinating world of IT, exploring everything from programming to artificial intelligence, and constantly expanding my skill set.</p>
            <p>The world of technology captivates me because of its limitless potential. Whether it's developing software, working on data analysis, or diving into the complexities of artificial intelligence, I thrive on the problem-solving and creativity that this field demands. Outside the classroom, I enjoy experimenting with new coding projects, staying up to date with the latest tech trends, and learning from the ever-evolving landscape of digital innovation.</p>
            <p>In addition to my studies, I’ve always had a strong interest in exploring how technology can bridge gaps in education and business, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and digital economics. I believe that technology not only shapes our future but also has the power to create opportunities for others. That’s why I’m passionate about using my skills to make a meaningful impact, whether it’s through a simple software solution or a larger-scale project.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, I am determined to continue growing both academically and personally. My journey in IT is just beginning, but I’m excited for what lies ahead. Every challenge presents a new opportunity for learning and improvement, and I am committed to making the most of this journey. Fueled by a desire to push boundaries, I am eager to explore the intersection of technology and business, striving to contribute to innovations that can make a real difference in the world.</p>
